1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initializing a repository allows git to track the changes made to the files
in the repository.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is different because it only temporarily stores files
to be committed as a logical unit. It is valuable because it gives the
flexibility to only commit specific files as opposed to all the files in a
repository.
