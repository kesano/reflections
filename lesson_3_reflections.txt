1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

I would want to use a remote repository when I am collaborating on a project with
multiple contributors, each of which producing code from their personal devices.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

So that a local change that has not yet been committed and pushed to the remote
repository does not get lost or overwritten.
