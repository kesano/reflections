1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

I would want to use a remote repository when I am collaborating on a project with
multiple contributors, each of which producing code from their personal devices.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

So that a local change that has not yet been committed and pushed to the remote
repository does not get lost or overwritten.

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use
one instead of another?

A fork is a clone of a repository on GitHub that is created on GitHubâ€™s servers
as opposed to locally. A clone is a copy of a local repository or a repository that
is on GitHub. A branch is an extension of an existing branch of commits, in which
new commits can be made that do not affect the official public version.
